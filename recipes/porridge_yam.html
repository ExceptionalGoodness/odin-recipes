    <h2>Decription</h2>
    <p>This yam porridge recipe tastes just like my mom’s. The only difference is that it uses basil which is not typical in my mom’s recipe. However, you can choose to add any herb or any leafy green of your choice like spinach, kale, or ugwu.</p>
    <p><h3>How Asaro is made</h3></p>
    <p>Asaro is made from Puna Yam which is boiled till it’s tender and it’s cooked in a blend of Peppers, Tomatoes, onions, palm oil, and seasoning. While the dish is more common in the Yoruba-speaking region of Nigeria, it is still a meal enjoyed by the majority alike each with their own regional variation.

        It is nicknamed “Asaro elepo rede rede” meaning yam porridge boldly colored with fresh palm oil and garnished to perfection.</p>
